A "material complaint" theme, inspired by a deep orange color, is an excellent way to create an interface that is both warm and commanding, suggesting urgency and importance without being overly aggressive. The deep orange serves as the primary color, while supporting colors and design choices create a balanced and functional theme.

üé® Color Palette
Primary Color
Deep Orange is the main color for branding and key interactive elements like buttons, progress bars, and active navigation links. This color is vibrant and draws attention, making it perfect for highlighting critical information or actions.

Hex: #FF5722

RGB: 255, 87, 34

Secondary Colors
A successful theme needs complementary colors to provide visual depth and hierarchy.

Dark Gray (#424242): Used for primary text and major structural elements. This provides a strong contrast to the deep orange and ensures readability.

Light Gray (#E0E0E0): Used for backgrounds, dividers, and inactive elements. This light neutral color allows the deep orange to stand out and gives the interface a clean, modern feel.

Accent Blue (#03A9F4): A cool-toned accent color that provides a visual break from the warm palette. Use this sparingly for notifications, informational links, or other elements that require a different kind of attention, creating a clear visual distinction from the deep orange.

‚úíÔ∏è Typography
The typography should be clean, legible, and modern to complement the Material Design aesthetic.

Headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.): Use a bold, sans-serif font like Roboto Condensed or Oswald to give headings a strong, authoritative presence.

Body Text: A clean and readable sans-serif font like Roboto or Open Sans is ideal. The dark gray color ensures that the body text is easy to read against a light background.

üñºÔ∏è Imagery and Iconography
Icons and other visual assets should be simple and follow a consistent style.

Icons: Use a flat or slightly filled icon style. The deep orange should be used for interactive icons (e.g., a "submit" button icon), while the dark gray is suitable for non-interactive or inactive icons.

Imagery: Images should be high-quality and, where possible, use a color palette that complements the theme. Avoid clashing colors to maintain a cohesive look.

üíª UI Component Style
All UI components should follow a consistent design language.

Buttons: Interactive buttons should have a solid deep orange background with white text. Hover and active states can be a slightly lighter or darker shade of the same orange.

Cards: Use a white or light gray background with subtle shadows to give them a sense of depth and separation from the main background.

Forms: Input fields should have a light background with a deep orange border when active, providing clear visual feedback to the user.

Dialogs and Alerts: These can use the deep orange for the main title or header to immediately signal their importance, while the body text remains in dark gray. The accent blue can be used for informational-only alerts.
